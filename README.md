# CoEvo
This is the repository for the disseration project "Open-Ended Dynamics of Prediction Games."
The library is being refactored and prepared for public inspection and use. The intention is
that all data relevant to the disseration will be both reproducible and accessible.
Todos:
* Additional documentation
* Additional test suites
* Organized and sensible API for reproducible configurations
* Completion of the GP organism along with continuous/harmonic prediction games
* Integration of the GNARL experiments
